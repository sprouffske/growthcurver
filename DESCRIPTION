Description: This is a simple package that fits the logistic equation to
    microbial growth curve data (e.g., repeated absorbance measurements
    taken from a plate reader over time). From this fit, a variety of
    metrics are provided, including the maximum growth rate,
    the doubling time, the carrying capacity, the area under the logistic
    curve, and the time to the inflection point.

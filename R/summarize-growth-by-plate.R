#' Summarize Growth Curves
#'
#' This function finds the parameters that describe the input data's growth
#' for a plate of growth curves.
#' It does so by fitting the logistic curve to your growth curve measurements.
#'
#' The logistic curve equation is
#' \deqn{N_t = \frac{N_0 K} {N_0 + (K-N_0)e^{-rt}}}{N_t = N_0 K / (N_0 + (K - N_0) exp(-rt))}
#' where \eqn{N_t} is the number
#' of cells (or the absorbance reading) at time t, \eqn{N_0} is the initial
#' cell count (or absorbance reading), K is the carrying capacity, and r is the
#' growth rate.
#'
#' The fitness proxies returned are the parameters of the logistic equation
#' and the area under the curve (a measure that integrates the effects
#' of \eqn{N_0}, K, and r). See \code{\link{gcfit}} for more documentation on these.
#'
#' This method expects that your data adhere to a particular format.
#'\itemize{
#'  \item The data are provided in a data.frame
#'  \item One column in the data.frame is named "time" and contains the
#'        time measurements (e.g., hours).
#'  \item Each remaining column contains the
#'        readings from a single well in a plate reader. The name of the column
#'        will be used to identify the sample in the output data.
#'  \item There are no missing values or non-numeric data in the data.frame.
#'}
#'
#' @param plate      A data.table with at least two columns. One column contains
#'                   timepoints that measurements were taken (e.g., hours) and
#'                   must be named "time". An optional column can be included
#'                   called "blank" that contains the blank readings for
#'                   background correction (make sure to select the "blank"
#'                   bg_correct option if you provide a blank column).
#'                   Each remaining column contains the
#'                   absorbance readings from a single well in a plate.
#' @param t_trim     Measurements taken after this time should not be included
#'                   in fitting the curve. If stationary phase is variable,
#'                   this may give you a better fit. A value of 0 means no
#'                   trimming. Defaults to no trimming (0).
#' @param bg_correct The background correction method to use. No background
#'                   correction is performed for "none". Specifying
#'                   "min" subtracts the smallest value in a column from all the
#'                   rows in that column, and specifying "blank" subtracts
#'                   the values from the blank vector from the data_n vector.
#' @param plot_fit   TRUE if you want to generate a pdf file that plots all
#'                   columns provided in the plate along with the growthcurver's
#'                   fit. The default value is FALSE, which generates no plots.
#' @param plot_file  The name of the file to save the plots to if you set
#'                   plot_fit to TRUE. The default file is called
#'                   "growthcurver.pdf".
#' @param width_     The number of plate columns. Defaults to 12 for typical
#'                   96-well plate.
#' @param height_    The number of plate rows. Defaults to 8 for typical
#'                   96-well plates.
#' @return           A data.table containing the summary metrics and residual
#'                   error from the fit of the logistic curve to the data.
#'                   The names of the input columns are used to identify each
#'                   well (or sample).
